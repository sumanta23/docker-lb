1. Overview
-----------

This application is intended to be used with the RedHat EAP 6 or the JBoss AS 7. For the AS 7 we recommend to use at least version 7.1.2 which can be found as a tag on github (it needs to be compiled by executing its build.sh):
    https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/tags

2. Compilation
--------------

Compile the server code with maven:
    > mvn package

You will then find a JAR in the target/ directory.

3. Execution
------------

You will need to start cluster-nodes and deploy the JAR into these nodes by copying it to $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/ .

Start the cluster nodes with the standalone-ha.xml configuration
    > $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c=standalone-ha.xml

If you start multiple cluster nodes on the same machine, you will need some more parameters to avoid conflicts:
    > $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c=standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server1
    > $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c=standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100

You could also bind the different cluster nodes to different interfaces. On MacOS you can set up multiple ips on you loopback device like this
    > sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 192.168.0.1
    > sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 192.168.0.2

Your cluster nodes would then be started like this:
    > $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c=standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server1 -b=192.168.0.1 -bmanagement=192.168.0.1
    > $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c=standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=Server2 -b=192.168.0.2 -bmanagement=192.168.0.2
